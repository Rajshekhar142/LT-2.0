    steps:
      # 1. Download the code from the repo
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Install Node.js (Version 20 matches most modern Next.js apps)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      # 3. Clean Install Dependencies
      # 'npm ci' is faster and stricter than 'npm install'. It relies on package-lock.json.
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4. Check Code Style (Linting)
      # This fails if you have unused variables or bad React patterns
      - name: Run Linter
        run: npm run lint

      # 5. Build the Project
      # Next.js 'build' automatically runs TypeScript checks.
      # If this passes, your app is production-ready.
